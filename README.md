Transparent Covid Vaccination Data Exploration based on Our World In Data (OWID) Dataset.

## [Correlation between Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccinations and Excess Mortality over Time](https://rawcdn.githack.com/Dabbrivia/owid-covid/fa99ea7df682d7fa3912a9f064901fad3cc18e98/owid-covid-vax-corr-interpolated.html)
Correlation is calculated per Country and Vaccine.

## Exploration of Various Approaches to the Visualisation and Modeling
See it [rendered on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/Dabbrivia/owid-covid/blob/main/owid-covid-vax-corr.ipynb)

Some charts may not be rendered by nbviewer, so it's probably better to download the notebook and run it locally.

# TODO: 
add https://github.com/kakumanu-sudhir/covid19/blob/master/weather_data_extraction/weather_data_extraction.ipynb as longitudinal weather data (confounding variable?)
